### Choosing a VM for the CMS app

Using a VM on The Cloud would signify lots of savings compared to buying a server to be set up on-premises, but a server for a simple app that is it just taking form could probably be seen as wasteful in terms of costs. In terms of workflow, using a VM would entail that developers would spend quite some time in the setup, since it is a server that needs to be managed, this also means that when scaling altough not representing a problem per se, it would mean more time consumed in the setup or changes. Referring to availability, if there is enough budget, it would be no problem. Summing up, choosing a VM would entail more costs in both time and resources, but with the benefit of having a more solid and planned infrastructure that would be recommended for later stages.
